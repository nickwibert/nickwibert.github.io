I am a recent M.S. Statistics graduate based in New York City. My professional/internship experience includes 3+ years with SQL and 2+ years with Python and R for querying, cleaning, and analyzing data to improve business processes. My academic experience includes coursework in formal mathematics, computer science, and statistical theory/applications, including regression modeling, hypothesis testing, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian methods.

In Summer 2022, I worked at the corporate offices of Publix Super Markets as a Student Data Analyst. In this role, I was tasked with creating an in-house replacement for an inventory shrinkage narrative report which was provided by an outside contractor. By the end of my 11 weeks, I had finished coding a production-ready reporting process from scratch (SQL/Python) which queries/ analyzes inventory shrink data and generates dynamic narrative PDF reports for all stores in under 1 hour, while also providing improved visual appeal and more valuable insights than the contractor's report. As of February 2024, this report is still run by Publix on a monthly basis, saving the company ~$90,000 per year.

Throughout my studies (2021-2024), I supported the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as a Database Specialist. I wrote complex SQL queries and designed reports for their [Materials Acceptance and Certification (MAC) system](https://mac.fdot.gov/) where they are run daily by Earthwork specialists throughout the state. My custom SQL code required complex logic for data cleaning, validation, and analysis amongst 10 different reports which I built and maintained. For a sample report, click the previous link and run the "ERS - Density" report, setting *Contract ID* to "T2831" and *Output* to "PDF".
