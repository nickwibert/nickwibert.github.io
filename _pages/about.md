I graduated from the University of Florida in May 2022 with a dual degree in Mathematics and Statistics as well as a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Statistics at Florida State University.

I also support the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as a Database Specialist. I write SQL queries and design reports for their [Materials Acceptance and Certification (MAC) system](https://mac.fdot.gov/) where they are run by Earthwork specialists throughout the state. For a sample report, click the previous link and run the "ERS - Density" report, setting *Contract ID* to "T2831" and *Output* to "PDF".

In Summer 2022, I worked at the corporate office of Publix Super Markets as a Student Data Analyst. In this role, I was tasked with creating an in-house replacement for an inventory shrinkage narrative report which was provided by an outside contractor. By the end of my 11 weeks, I had a production-ready solution in the form of a Python notebook hosted in Databricks which queried/processed data and generated dynamic narrative PDF reports for all stores in under an hour, while also providing more visual appeal and more valuable insights than the contractor's report. This process is currently run by Publix on a monthly basis, saving the company ~$90,000 per year.
