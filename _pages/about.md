I graduated from the University of Florida in May 2022 with a dual degree in Mathematics and Statistics as well as a minor in Computer Science. I will be pursuing an MS in Statistics at Florida State University starting in August 2022.

Currently, I am spending the summer interning at the Publix Super Markets Corporate Office as a Student Data Analyst with the Business Analysis and Reporting (BAR) department.

I also support the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as a Database Specialist at their State Materials Office. I write SQL queries and build reports for their [Materials Acceptance and Certification (MAC) system.](https://mac.fdot.gov/)
