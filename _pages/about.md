I am a recent MS Statistics graduate from Florida State University relocating to New York City. My professional/internship experience includes 3+ years with SQL and 2+ years with Python and R for data processing/analysis to improve business processes. My academic experience includes coursework in statistical theory and applications, including regression modeling, hypothesis testing, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian methods.

Throughout my studies, I supported the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as a Database Specialist. I wrote SQL queries and designed reports for their [Materials Acceptance and Certification (MAC) system](https://mac.fdot.gov/) where they are run daily by Earthwork specialists throughout the state. For a sample report, click the previous link and run the "ERS - Density" report, setting *Contract ID* to "T2831" and *Output* to "PDF".

In Summer 2022, I worked at the corporate offices of Publix Super Markets as a Student Data Analyst. In this role, I was tasked with creating an in-house replacement for an inventory shrinkage narrative report which was provided by an outside contractor. By the end of my 11 weeks, I had a production-ready solution in the form of a Python notebook hosted in Databricks which queried/processed data and generated dynamic narrative PDF reports for all stores in under an hour, while also providing more visual appeal and more valuable insights than the contractor's report. As of February 2024, this report is still run by Publix on a monthly basis, saving the company ~$90,000 per year.
