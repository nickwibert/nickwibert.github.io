    **[r/A24: A film community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/A24)**  
</span>
<span style="font-size:0.7em;line-height:0.1em;">
    I took over as sole moderator of this subreddit in March 2019. It was abandoned and sat at around 1k inactive members.
    Over the course of the next year, I grew the subreddit to 30k members by creating original designs, starting a weekly discussion thread,
    and marketing the subreddit heavily across the site and other social media platforms.

<span style="font-size:0.7em;line-height:0.1em;">
    During that time I also gradually brought more moderators onto the team, and eventually took a step back from managing the site to focus on my school and work. The subreddit currently sits at ~170k members and is still going strong.
