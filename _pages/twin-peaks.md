I built this game in Unity by modifying C# scripts provided by the course instructor
and designing the pixel art/animations from scratch. The characters and properties represented
are from the Twin Peaks film/television series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. The music
is composed by Angelo Badalamenti.
